# WGAN-GP
A python3&torch1.+ implementation of WGAN-GP.

# Prerequisites
- Python3.6+
- torch 1.+
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- A nvidia GPU

# Acknowledge 
Based on the code of [[caogang/wgan-gp]](https://github.com/search?q=WGAN-GP).

(**Motivation**: when I use the code of [[caogang/wgan-gp]](https://github.com/search?q=WGAN-GP), I got stuck at the data loading stage. Hence I build this version of WGAN-GP, which works fine under my environment.
